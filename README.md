**GNSS and LoRaWAN Integration with Arduino**

This project, built by Andy Stevens from Ant-Networks, demonstrates how to integrate a GNSS (GPS) module with a LoRaWAN-capable Arduino board (such as the MKR WAN series) to send real-time location data to The Things Network (TTN) using Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA). The code reads location data (latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and satellite count) from the GNSS module, formats it, and transmits it over LoRaWAN.
Features

  GNSS Integration: Retrieves location data, altitude, speed, and satellite count.
  LoRaWAN Communication: Uses the MKRWAN library for LoRa communication with TTN.
  Low Power Consumption: Designed for efficient data retrieval and transmission, ideal for battery-powered projects.
  Payload Optimization: Scales and encodes data for efficient 9-byte transmission.

Hardware Requirements

  Arduino MKR WAN board (e.g., MKR WAN 1300 or MKR WAN 1310)
  GNSS module compatible with the SparkFun u-blox GNSS library
  Connection cables and a computer for programming the Arduino

Libraries Used

  Wire - for I2C communication with the GNSS module
  SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library - for GNSS module interaction
  KRWAN - for LoRaWAN communication
  arduino_secrets.h - for storing TTN credentials securely

Setup

  Clone this repository and open the project in the Arduino IDE.
  Install the necessary libraries using the Library Manager in Arduino IDE:
      Wire
      SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library
      MKRWAN
    Add a file named arduino_secrets.h in your project folder with your TTN credentials:

  cpp

    #define appEui "YOUR_APP_EUI"
    #define appKey "YOUR_APP_KEY"

    Connect the GNSS module to the I2C pins on the Arduino (typically SDA and SCL).

Usage

  Upload the code to the Arduino board.
  Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud rate) to observe debugging information.
  The code will:
        Initialize the GNSS and LoRa modules.
        Join the TTN network using OTAA.
        Wait for a valid GPS signal.
        Periodically transmit GPS data (every 1 minute) to TTN over LoRa.

LoRa Data Packet Structure

The 9-byte data packet sent over LoRa includes:

    Latitude (3 bytes)
    Longitude (3 bytes)
    Altitude (1 byte)
    Speed (1 byte)
    Satellite count (1 byte)

Serial Monitor Output

The code outputs debugging information, including GPS coordinates, altitude, and satellite count. Example output:

Mathematica

Location: 37.7749295, -122.4194155
Altitude: 15.3 m
Number of satellites: 5
Payload data: 1A 2B 3C 4D 5E 6F 07 08 09
Data sent successfully!

Customization

  LoRa Frequency Region: Change the frequency region in the modem.begin() call in the setup() function (default is EU868).
  Transmission Frequency: Adjust the delay in the loop() function to change how often data is sent (default is 60 seconds).
